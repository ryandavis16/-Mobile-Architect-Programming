Summary and Goals

Weight Watcha’s is an Android app I made to help people track their daily weight and stay motivated toward their health goals. The goal was to make something simple that lets users log their weight see progress and keep track of their journey without needing a complicated setup. It gives users a quick and private way to monitor changes over time.

Screens and Features

The app has a login screen a grid screen to add and view entries and an SMS screen that lets users send motivational messages to themselves. Each screen is designed to be easy to use with simple layouts clear text and buttons that are easy to find. I wanted the app to feel natural so users could figure it out right away without needing instructions. Keeping the design clean and showing the most important actions first helped make it more user friendly.

Coding Process and Techniques

I built the app one piece at a time starting with the layouts before writing the Kotlin code. I tested the layouts on different emulators to make sure they worked on various devices. The app uses an SQLite database to save data locally so it works even without the internet. I also added SMS features with permission checks so users can choose when messages are sent. Working in small steps and testing often helped me stay organized and made debugging easier. I plan to use that same approach in future projects.

Testing and Importance

I tested the app on several emulators and one real phone to make sure everything worked the same across devices. I checked login validation data entry and the SMS feature. Testing was important because it helped catch small issues early like missing permissions or layouts that didn’t fit right. It also showed me how Android versions can affect the way features behave which helped me make adjustments.

Overcoming Challenges and Innovation

One challenge was handling SMS permissions while keeping the rest of the app functional if the user said no. I fixed that by letting the app still run normally without sending texts. I also had to adjust layouts so they looked right on different screen sizes. Small improvements like that made the app feel more complete and professional.

Areas of Success

I think the best part of my work was connecting the front end with the database and SMS features. Seeing new entries appear right away on the grid screen made the app feel finished. Building Weight Watcha’s from start to finish taught me how to plan test and improve while always keeping the user experience in mind.
